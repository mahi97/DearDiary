## Week in Review

I find myself more productive than before, I almost define some goals and plan for myself to pursue the research. However, I didn't asked professor oponion.
Finnally Professor push me a little and I finished a memory augmented litreture, 
not directly my intrest but it was around for a while as a dangling task and I start to hate it for no reseaon. Now I feel releived.

Professor Jinkyoo Park replaid to my email, I looking forward to have talk with him next week :D
