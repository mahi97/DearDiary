## Week in Review

Most productive things that I've done in this week was watching lectures, reading bayesian papers and discuss them in group, and talk with some people about MARL.
So not very productive and still I don't follow my dreams and I start forgetting do I ever had any dreams or not. I have to get back on track of learning more about game theory,
and applied game theory on Multi-Agent settings.

I hope talking about this things with people in KAIST will lead me toward this kind of research, especially guys from 617 and ISYSE.
