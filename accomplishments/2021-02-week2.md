## Week in Review

This week I talked with Daiki about MARL, He was really briliant guy and I liked his unique perspective to sciense and especially Multi-Agent system. 
I wish, I can collaborate with him in future.

I was feeling I becoming a machine which come to lab and goes to dorm with no purpose, mostly acting reactive and no individuality, it's not what I signed up for.
So I decide to relax a bit and find myself, I went to Jeju Island vacation.

I'm going to start reading MARL papers for next week as hard as Bayesian Reading Group and I hope I can find some good problem.
